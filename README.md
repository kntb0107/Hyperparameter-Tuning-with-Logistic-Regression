# Hyperparameter Tuning with Logistic Regression
Optimisation and Deep Learning course project

# Contents

1. Data Understanding
2. EDA
3. Data Transformation: Feature Scaling using RobustScalar
4. Feature Importance: Tree models - Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
5. Modelling: Logistic Regression
6. Tuning: GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV

# Findings

- There is no strong correlation between likeability of the songs vs. the songs attributes present in the dataset chosen
- The data was then tuned using the aforementioned tuning methods including data splitting (80 - 20) and choosing the features shown during Feature importance.
